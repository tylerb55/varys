# Varys

A tool designed to aggregate online reviews from various platforms (e.g., Google Reviews, TripAdvisor) and apply AI analysis to provide insights into overall customer sentiment and key discussion topics.

## About The Project

Understanding customer feedback is crucial, but reviews are often spread across multiple websites. Varys acts as an information gatherer, connecting to these sources, analyzing the content, and presenting a unified picture of public opinion.

It aims to identify the overall mood (sentiment) and recurring themes (keywords) within the reviews, helping businesses quickly grasp what their customers are saying.

* **Centralized Dashboard:** View key metrics and recent reviews in one place.
* **AI Sentiment Analysis:** Classifies reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
